                <p>Carl Edward Sagan was an American astronomer, planetary scientist, 
                    cosmologist, astrophysicist, astrobiologist, author, and science communicator. His best known scientific contribution 
                    is research on extraterrestrial life, including experimental demonstration of the production of amino acids from basic chemicals by radiation.
                    Sagan argued the hypothesis, accepted since, that the high surface temperatures of Venus can be attributed to, and calculated using, the greenhouse effect. He testified to the 
                    US Congress in 1985 that the greenhouse effect will change the earth's climate system.

                    narrated and co-wrote the award-winning 1980 television series Cosmos: A Personal Voyage. The most widely watched series in the history 
                    of American public television, Cosmos has been seen by at least 500 million people in 60 countries. The book Cosmos was published to 
                    accompany the series. He also wrote the 1985 science fiction novel Contact, the basis for a 1997 film of the same name. His papers, 
                    containing 595,000 items, are archived at The Library of Congress.

                    Sagan advocated scientific skeptical inquiry and the scientific method, pioneered exobiology and promoted the Search for 
                    Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence (SETI). He spent most of his career as a professor of astronomy at Cornell University, where 
                    he directed the Laboratory for Planetary Studies. Sagan and his works received numerous awards and honors, including the NASA 
                    Distinguished Public Service Medal, the National Academy of Sciences Public Welfare Medal, the Pulitzer Prize for General 
                    Non-Fiction for his book The Dragons of Eden, and, regarding Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, two Emmy Awards, the Peabody Award, 
                    and the Hugo Award. He married three times and had five children. After suffering from myelodysplasia, Sagan died of 
                    pneumonia at the age of 62, on December 20, 1996.
